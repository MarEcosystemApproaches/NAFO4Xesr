### About this report
This Ecosystem Summary Report provides the ecosystem context to support an Ecosystem Approach at DFO that includes Ecosystem Approaches to Fisheries Management ([EAFM](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fisheries-peches/initiatives/ecosystems-approach-approche-ecosystemique/index-eng.html) [2019; Bill C-68](https://lop.parl.ca/sites/PublicWebsite/default/en_CA/ResearchPublications/LegislativeSummaries/421C68E)) and Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management ([EBFM](https://sites.google.com/view/maritimesebfmwg/home)). It aligns objectives broadly to those of the [Maritimes Ecosystem Based Management Framework](https://sites.google.com/view/ebminitiative/ebm-initiative-home) and regional/area-based objectives that contribute to Scientific Advice and Management Plans or other Harvest Strategies and liked to a suite of ecosystem indicators (Table 1). The trends and the status of ecosystem indicators are reported relative to a reference point (if available) or a long-term average. The results are synthesized to outline potential implications for the management area examined, but not specifically related to a focal stock or species.

# A. Pressures and Stressors {#pressuresandstressors}

## Climate and oceanography 
The management area is strongly influenced by natural variability of the climate system (e.g., North Atlantic Oscillation) and, therefore, long-term monitoring is needed to determine how anthropogenic climate change is affecting ocean temperatures. 

Changes in climate can directly and indirectly impact stock status by affecting the distribution, seasonal timing, physiology, migration and spawning of marine species.

### North Atlantic Oscillation Index
[Hebert et al. 2024](https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2024/mpo-dfo/Fs97-18-380-eng.pdf) (see Section 2.1)

```{r ,fig.align="center", echo = FALSE,fig.pos='H', fig.width = 5, fig.height=3,fig.cap="The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, defined as the winter (December, January, February, March) 500 mb pressure Principal Component Analysis which is representative of the difference between the Icelandic low and Azores high. Climatological mean is shown as the dashed line, solid lines are ± standard deviation (SD)."}

dat.dir<-here::here("data")
dd <- "dd_nao_.Rdata"
  load(file.path(dat.dir, dd))

  mean_value <- 0.08
  sd_value <- 0.37
  nao<-dd[["data"]]

  nao01<-plot_nao(nao, year, nao, mean_value, sd_value, y_label = "NAO" )
  nao01

```

- In 2023, the winter (December–March) North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index was below the 1991 – 2020 mean, –0.31 (–0.84 SD). A high NAO index corresponds to an intensification of the pressure difference between the Icelandic Low and the Azores High. Strong northwest winds, cold air and sea temperatures, and heavy ice in the Labrador Sea and on the NL shelf areas, are usually associated with a high positive NAO index ([Colbourne et al. 1994](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/E-Colbourne-2/publication/281064239_Climatic_changes_and_environmental_conditions_in_the_Northwest_Atlantic_1970-1993/links/55d31fc508aec1b0429f2dee/Climatic-changes-and-environmental-conditions-in-the-Northwest-Atlantic-1970-1993.pdf); Drinkwater 1996). The opposite response (warm, salty conditions) occurs during years with a negative NAO index ([Petrie 2007](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3137/ao.450302)). 

- The NAO has been shown to strongly affect bottom temperature distributions throughout the region from the Labrador Shelf to the Gulf of Maine ([Petrie 2007](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3137/ao.450302)). The response is bimodal, the product of direct and advective effects, with positive (negative) NAO generally corresponding to colder- (warmer-) than-normal bottom temperatures over the Labrador-Newfoundland Shelf, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and the Eastern Scotian Shelf, and warmer- (colder-) than-normal conditions on the Central and Western Scotian Shelf and in the Gulf of Maine. 

\newpage
### Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly
Temperature anomalies are the deviations from the long-term means, or as standardized anomalies they are the anomaly divided by the Standard Deviation (SD). If the data permit, the long-term means and SDs are calculated for the 30-year base period of 1991–2020. The use of standardized anomalies and the same base period allow direct comparison of anomalies among sites and variables.

[Hebert et al. 2024](https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2024/mpo-dfo/Fs97-18-380-eng.pdf) (see Section 3)

```{r,fig.show='hold',fig.align="center", fig.pos='H', echo = FALSE, fig.cap="The annual sea-surface-temperature normalized anomaly for NAFO regions within the NAFO4VS derived from satellite imagery compared to their long-term monthly means. Horizontal solid lines represent ± standard deviation (SD) for the 1991-2020 period. Regime shift analysis results from running the method forwards and backwards on the time series depicted by the blue and red horizontal lines, respectively. "}

psstSatellite4Vs
  
```

- The annual SST anomalies during 2023 were higher than average and SST remained above normal, with the last four years being the four warmest years in the NAFO 4VS. A regime shift algorithm to detect a step change using mean levels was applied to the annual time-series ([Rodionov 2004](https://doi.org/10.1029/2004GL019448)). Over the length of the record, the temperature has three distinct periods at all regions, a relatively cooler period from 1982 to 1993, near the climatological mean from 1994 to 2011, and a relatively warmer period from 2012 to present.

\newpage 
### Bottom Temperature Anomaly
[Hebert et al. 2024](https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2024/mpo-dfo/Fs97-18-380-eng.pdf) (see Section 8.2)

```{r,fig.align="center", echo = FALSE, fig.pos='H', fig.cap="Time series of July bottom-temperature anomalies for NAFO regions within the NAFO4VS.

```
- The near-bottom temperature anomalies for 2023 in NAFO 4VS are in the normal range in 2022-2023 following an elevated period of bottom temperatures from years 2010-2021.

### Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Bottom Temperature

pbt_4Vs<-plot_indicator(BottomT_ind_4Vs, YEAR, Bottom_Temp, y_label="4Vs Bottom Temp")

  
(pSST_4Vs)/(pbt_4Vs)

```
- Over the past two decades, the Scotian Shelf has incurred rapid warming due to the increased dominance of Warm Slope Water. 

- SST in NAFO 4VS between 2020-2024 is above the reference period mean (1991-2020), indicating above average sea temperatures in the NAFO 4VS over recent years. 

- Bottom temperature in the 2023-2024 period in NAFO 4VS is near the period mean indicating a recent cooling period after record warm bottom temperatures from 2012-2020 in the management area.

### Stratification, salinity
```{r, fig.align="center", echo = FALSE, fig.pos='H',fig.width=11.7, fig.height=6.3, fig.cap="Stratification and salinity (ppt) for the ESS from 1970-2018.

Yellow and blue dots are measurements above or below the long-term means, respectively."}

  filter(ID=="ESS") |> 
  select(YEAR, Salinity)

  psal<-plot_indicator(Salinity, YEAR, Salinity, y_label="Salinity (ppt)") 

pstrat + psal 

```
- Salinity and stratification are currently only analysed at the larger spatial scales, and currently only reported at the level of the Eastern Scotian Shelf (NAFO 4VN, 4VS, 4W combined).

- Salinity and stratification in the Eastern Scotian Shelf have been generally higher, with more years above the long-term mean in the ESS since the early 1990s. In later years (2018), both were slightly below the long-term mean, but within a normal range. These trends are consistent with SST trends for the Eastern Scotian Shelf.

\newpage
### Ocean Acidification
Ocean acidification is the reduction of seawater pH levels, caused by the increased rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) release from post-industrial anthropogenic activities. In general, the ocean absorbs approximately 26% of total carbon emissions ([Friedlingstein et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-17-965-2025)), thereby buffering the global climate. However the rate of CO2 release from human activities is unprecedented, leading to changes in seawater chemistry, resulting in reductions of seawater pH, increased levels of CO2 in the seawater (pCO2), and reducing the saturation state and therefore biological availability of important shell-forming calcium carbonate minerals (aragonite and calcite).

Galbraith *et al.* 2025 (in press)

```{r ,fig.align="center", echo = FALSE, fig.pos='H',fig.width = 8, out.width="80%",fig.pos='H', fig.cap="Time series of near-bottom water annual averages for: in situ pHT (pH on the total scale, upper left panel); substrate-inhibitor ratio (SIR in mol µmol-1, upper right panel); saturation state of aragonite (ΩA - unitless, lower left panel); and saturation state of calcite (ΩC - unitless, lower right panel) at stations ˃ 100 m in depth, at AZMP sections in the Maritimes regions from 2014 to 2024. A grey cell indicates missing data; a white cell is a value within 0.5 SD of the climatological mean based on data from 2014 to 2020 inclusively; a red cell indicates above normal values; a blue cell indicates below normal values. More intense colors indicate larger anomalies. Climatological means and standard deviations are shown on the right side of each panel. Boxes with borders (either dark grey or white) in the substrate-inhibitor ratio, saturation state of aragonite and saturation state of calcite panels correspond to values at or below the thresholds of 0.1, 1 and 1, respectively. Near-bottom values represent the deepest observations."}

knitr::include_graphics(here("figures", "OA Maritimes.png"))
```
- The Atlantic Canadian surface seawater is declining faster than the global average by 0.03-0.04 units per decade compared to 0.017-0.027 ([Bernier et al. 2023](https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2023/mpo-dfo/Fs97-6-3544-eng.pdf)). The 2020-2024 period of AZMP data shows that the annual averages of near-bottom seawater pH has been mostly below normal to normal for the NAFO 4 region, with record lows of total pH (pHT), observed for the 4V Louisbourg region in 2022.

- Overall there is a trend of normal to deteriorating ocean acidification conditions in near-bottom waters in the Atlantic Zone since 2020 (as demonstrated by pHT, saturation states of calcium carbonate and substrate inhibitor ratios). 

- For many Atlantic clam species (e.g. *Mactromeris polynyma*) shells are predominantly composed of aragonite, therefore if ocean acidification conditions continue to increase then there may be impacts to the recruitment and growth rates of this species; surface seawater pH monitoring would help assess larval exposure conditions.    

\newpage
## Longer-term climate change 

Ocean model long-term forecast and projections provide a general expectation of how the world may change. Ocean model projections use low and high emissions pathways as future scenarios to frame expectations of the future ocean climate.

```{r long-termclimate,fig.align="center", echo = FALSE, fig.pos='H',fig.width = 8, out.width="80%",fig.pos='H', fig.cap="Future scenarios for sea surface temperature changes for ecoregions in Canada. Regions 1) Gulf of Maine and 2) Scotian Shelf are within the Maritimes Region."}

knitr::include_graphics(here("figures", "SSPs_2040P_change_annual.png"))
```

- In the Scotian Shelf by 2050, the onset of spring is expected to occur 3-4 weeks earlier than present day and the growing season is expected to last 4-6 weeks longer ([Brickman & Shackell, 2024](https://online.ucpress.edu/elementa/article/12/1/00001/203135)) 

- Projected changes in sea surface temperature (2040-2059 relative to present day) for the Scotian Shelf and Gulf of Maine range from approximately 1.5 to 2.5°C (based on IPCC scenarios SSP2-4.5 to SSP5-8.5) ([Wang et al, 2024](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07055900.2023.2264832)).  

- With a rapidly changing ocean, we can expect shifts in productivity and distribution in the NAFO 4VS, as well as shifts in the seasonal timing of fish and invertebrate reproductive cycles.

- By 2100, under both low and high emissions scenario, most marine species across the Canadian portion of the NW Atlantic are from moderate to high climate risk, and indeed, are at a lower risk compared to many areas around the globe, especially tropical ecosystems. While the NW Atlantic is warming rapidly, the resident species are, on average, widespread across the seascape, and are accustomed to a wider range of temperatures ([Boyce et al. 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44183-024-00067-5)). 

- However, formerly commercial but now depleted species will be at much greater risk due to their low population sizes  ([Boyce et al. 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44183-024-00067-5), see Fig 5 for list).

### Fishing Pressure
[Bundy et al. 2017](https://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/9.845487/publication.html) (see Table S4 for definitions, see Table S5 for species categories)

This indicator measures the level of exploitation or total fishing pressure at the ecosystem level (Landings/Biomass). Change in this indicator can result from change in biomass, landings or both. 

```{r ,fig.align="center", echo = FALSE,fig.pos='H', fig.pos='H', fig.cap="Fishing Pressure (FP) calculated from DFO Summer Research Vessel survey. Data have been corrected for catchability with the exception of invertebrates. Dashed lines denote long-term means, solid green lines denote ± standard deviation (SD) from the available timeseries.

pa4<-plot_indicator(fp_inv, YEAR, FP_INVERTEBRATES, y_label="Invertebrate FP")
 

(pa1|pa2)/(pa3|pa4)

```

- The 2018 fishing pressures (removed to better reflect the long-term means) are artificially high due to the lack of Summer Research Vessel survey in NAFO 4VS for that year, while landings remained stable.

- The latest robust estimates of overall fishing pressure in NAFO 4VS (2020) has been below the long-term average since around 1995. 

- Fishing pressure on gadoids and forage fish in NAFO 4VS have been below the long-term mean since the 1990s. In contrast, fishing pressure on invertebrates has been close to the long-term average in recent years.

```

- Commercial fisheries landings for forage fish and gadoids have generally been below the long-term average since the 2000s. 

- Invertebrates landings have been increasing over time, but have been in decreasing over the last 5 years (yet remain above the long-term mean). These trends coincide with shifting availability of species in the area.

## Productivity 
Productivity relates to the amount of energy or biomass generated in an ecosystem, providing energy to consumers. A number of factors play a role in primary and secondary production including nitrate, chlorophyll, bloom statistics, *Calanus finmarchicus* biomass, and meso-zooplankton biomass.

Such indicators are generally coupled to timing shifts in managed stocks since these can result in changes in habitat quality or food availability within the year. Changes in the timing phytoplankton blooms and shifts in zooplankton communities are thought to be critical indicators of changes in ecosystem productivity. 

### Nitrate, Chlorophyll
[Casault et al. 2024](https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2024/mpo-dfo/Fs97-6-3589-eng.pdf)

 The amount of available nutrient supply for phytoplankton production is represented by surface (0-50 m) and subsurface (50-150 m) nutrient concentrations

```{r fig.align="center", echo = FALSE, fig.pos='H', fig.cap="Nitrate 0-50m, Nitrate 50-150, integrated chlorophyll 1-100m from Louisburg Line (LL) that occurs within NAFO 4VS,  from 1999-2023. Dashed lines represent the mean, solid green lines denote ± standard deviation (SD). Purple, shaded areas are the latest 5 years of available data. Yellow and blue dots are measurements above or below the long-term means, respectively."}

#   load(file.path(dat.dir, AZMP_nutrients))

        filter (section=="LL") |>
        select(year, integrated_nitrate_0_50)
   
    nitrate_50_150<-azmpdata::Derived_Annual_Sections |>
        filter (section=="LL") |>
        select(year, integrated_nitrate_50_150)

    PP_ind<- azmpdata::Derived_Annual_Sections|>
        filter( section =="LL")|>
        select(year, integrated_chlorophyll_0_100)  


ph3<-plot_indicator(nitrate_0_50, year, integrated_nitrate_0_50, y_label="Nitrate 0-50m")
ph4<-plot_indicator(nitrate_50_150, year, integrated_nitrate_50_150, y_label="Nitrate 50-150m")
ph1<-plot_indicator(PP_ind, year, integrated_chlorophyll_0_100, y_label="Integrated chl 0-100m")

(ph3/ph4/ph1)

```

- The latest year (2023) of nitrate values show a decrease from the previous year, but both are within the mean range. 

- Integrated chlorophyll has increased in 2023, and also remains within the mean range. 

- Although recent warming would suggest a shift to higher nutrient concentrations across the Scotian Shelf (SS) region, recent evaluation of the long-term trends in nutrient availability across the SS has actually shown a decrease in nutrient availability since 2010, the onset of this warming period.

### Bloom statistics

```
- In the Eastern Scotian Shelf bloom statistics are within the long-term mean range for the latest year (2020), and show no long-term or short term (5 year) trend over time. 

### *Calanus finmarchicus*, meso-zooplankton Biomass
```{r fig.align="center", echo = FALSE,fig.pos='H', fig.cap="Zooplankton biomass (dry weight), from NAFO 4V. Dashed lines represent the mean, solid green lines denote ± standard deviation (SD).

(pcf4v/pzp4v)
```
- The most recent estimates (2023) *C. finmarchicus* biomass in NAFO 4V has been lower than the long-term average.

- Most recent estimates of zooplankton biomass remain close to average since 2019 in NAFO 4V.

### Large Fish Indicator (LFI)

[Bundy et al. 2017](https://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/9.845487/publication.html) (see Table S4 for definitions and details)

LFI is an estimate of the proportion of large fish in the community or proportion of biomass occupying the top predator trophic-level ([Greenstreet and Rogers 2006](https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/63/4/573/690519#139793319)). 

```{r fig.align="center", echo = FALSE,fig.pos='H',fig.width = 5, fig.height=3, fig.cap="Large fish indicator from RV survey data that has been corrected for catchability. Dashed lines represent the mean, solid green lines denote ± standard deviation (SD). Purple, shaded areas are the latest 5 years of available data. Yellow and blue dots are measurements above or below the long-term means, respectively."}
dat.dir<-here::here("data")
eco_indicators<- "eco_indicators_nafo.Rdata"
  load(file.path(dat.dir, eco_indicators))
  
  
LFI<-eco_indicators_nafo |>
  filter(ID=="4VS", YEAR<2021)|>
  mutate_all(~ifelse(YEAR == 2018, NA, .)) |>
        select(YEAR, LargeFishIndicator)

  
pLFI<-MAReco::plot_indicator(LFI, YEAR, LargeFishIndicator, y_label="Large Fish Indicator")

(pLFI)
```

- LFI in the NAFO 4VS area has varied over time across two periods pre and post the mid 1990s. Latest four years indicate that LFI is below the long-term mean and indicate that structure and functioning of NAFO 4VS ecosystem may currently be more dominated by smaller fish and invertebrates in the ecological community.

## Biodiversity 
Biodiversity is described as the variety and variability among living organisms from all sources ([CBD](https://www.cbd.int/convention)). It is linked to ecosystem resilience and plays an important role in maintaining functionality and productivity of ecosystems. Biodiversity can relate to genetic, species, guild and ecosystem diversity. 

### Shannon Diversity Index, Margalef Richness, Heip's Evenness
[Bundy et al. 2017](https://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/9.845487/publication.html) (see Table S4)

Shannon Diversity Index accounts for both abundance and evenness of species present in a community. Margalef Richness measures the number of species present accounting for sampling effects. Heips Evenness measures how equally the species richness contributes to the total abundance or biomass of the community. Due to improvements in species identification over time, long-term Shannon Diversity and Margalef richness can be misleading, only years 2000-2020 were used here. 

```{r fig.align="center", echo = FALSE, fig.pos='H', fig.cap="Shannon diversity Index, Margalef Richness, Hieps Evenness measured from data collected from DFO's Summer RV survey and has been corrected for catchability.Dashed lines represent the mean, solid green lines denote ± standard deviation (SD). Purple, shaded areas are the latest 5 years of available data. Yellow and blue dots are measurements above or below the long-term means, respectively."}

  pj3<-plot_indicator(Margalef, YEAR, MargalefRichness_ALL, y_label= "Margalef Richness") 

  
(pj1|pj3)/(pj2)
  
```
 
- Anomalous low values in 2018 are due to lack of RV survey data for the NAFO 4VS, and have been removed.  

- Biodversity measures through time in the NAFO 4VS indicate that the NAFO 4VS is currently generally composed of fewer dominant species. While improving sampling protocols in the RV surveys have increased Margalef Richness over the last 5 years, the species diversity has been lower (lower mean range) in the last 5 years. Heips evenness has been relatively low since the 2000s, the low values (<0.2) is consistent with a community with generally fewer, species that are highly abundant. 

### Guild-level Biomass

[Bundy et al. 2017](https://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/9.845487/publication.html) (see Table S4 for definitions, see Table S5 for species categories)

Guild-level biomasses address structural attributes of food webs, and can also serve as proxies for ecosystem functioning ([Tam et al. 2017](https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/74/7/2040/2970046)).This indicator includes multiple guilds for fish and invertebrates from the RV Survey.

```
- Anomalous low values in 2018 are due to lack of RV survey data for the NAFO 4VS, and have been removed. 

- Generally, due to low catchability of invertebrates in the RV survey, invertebrates are likely underestimated, but trends are considered reliable.

- Total biomass of all commercial fish species combined are generally decreasing over the last 5 years, with both invertebrates and forage fish experiencing decreases in the most recent year. 

- Since the collapse of gadoids in the lates 1980s and early 1990s, biomass has been low. It increased to vary around the long-term mean from the mid 2000s to mid 2010s, but has declined since.

- Forage fish have been relatively stable in the NAFO 4VS with annual biomass within or above the long-term mean since the mid-1980s. In the last couple years forage fish biomass has been close to the long-term mean.

### Landed value (CAD) by species catagory

This is the landed value of groups of species for the NAFO 4VS region. Exploration of this data was based on published overviews of Canadian [Seafisheries landings](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/stats/commercial/sea-maritimes-eng.htm).

```

- Historical trends indicate that groundfish had higher landed value in the 1990s than mollusc and crustaceans or pelagic and estuarial fish in the NAFO 4VS, but recent landings are dominated by mollusc and crustaceans. 

- In the last 5 years, the landed value of mollusc and crustaceans in NAFO 4VS have fluctuated while still remaining high. Although conservation concerns for many invertebrate species is low, variability in landed value could have impacts to coastal communities. In contrast, recent 5 year landed values of groundfish and pelagic groups have remained stable in the NAFO 4VS.
